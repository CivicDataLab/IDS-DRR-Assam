# Mission Antyodaya Transformer
This script transforms the Mission Antyodaya excel dataset, which is attached to sub districts to revenue circles

# How does it works
It loops over each row and based on the co-ordinates adds a column `revenue_circle`

# Notes
The input file only has 500 rows from the [original file](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jVhsf9N410T2LwIN9-GJ0wNI1r_SEbKp/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=109659935473365455052&rtpof=true&sd=true) and so does the output. This was done to speed up the development. Downlaod original file and run the script over it for complete data.
