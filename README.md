# Intelligent Data Solution for Disaster Risk Reduction (IDS-DRR) 
*Previously IDEA-FRM*

Extreme weather events are arguably the most visible manifestation of the climate change crisis and India has witnessed several aversive extreme weather events. In  Assam where annual floods acutely affect 40% of the state, floods in 2022 alone resulted in over 190 deaths and affected over 8 million people (as per data compiled from ASDMA’s daily FRIMS reports which this repo hosts).

Good quality, machine-readable and interoperable data to inform on strategies to correctly plan for flood response and relief is currently unavailable. Despite multiple initiatives by the state bodies the comprehensive, usable intelligence from the multiple sources of information avaialble in silos is amiss. With the [‘Intelligent Data Ecosystem in Assam - Flood Response and Management (IDEA-FRM)’](https://github.com/CivicDataLab/IDEA-FRM) we tried to solve this problem by creating interoperable datasets on Flood management for the state of Assam. 

With IDS-DRR, we are keen to build on the IDEA-FRM project by building data pipelines so that datasets are updated automatically and thus data-driven governance can be installed.
