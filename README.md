Extreme weather events are arguably the most visible manifestation of the climate change crisis and India has witnessed several aversive extreme weather events. In  Assam where annual floods acutely affect 40% of the state, floods in 2022 alone resulted in over 190 deaths and affected over 8 million people (as per data compiled from ASDMA’s daily FRIMS reports which this repo hosts).
 Good quality, machine-readable and interoperable data to inform on strategies to correctly plan for flood response and relief is currently unavailable. Despite multiple initiatives by the state bodies the comprehensive, usable inteliigence from the multiple sources of information avaialble in silos is amiss which this project, ‘Intelligent Data Ecosystem in Assam - Flood Response and Management (IDEA-FRM)’ aims to achieve. 

India has experienced a number of harmful extreme weather events, which are undoubtedly manifestation of the climate change. According to data derived from ASDMA's daily FRIMS reports, Assam, where annual floods severely damage 40% of the state, floods in 2022  alone claimed over 190 lives and affected over 8 million people.

Currently, there is a lack of high-quality, machine-readable, and interoperable data that may be used to guide the development of flood response and relief programmes. This project, "Intelligent Data Ecosystem in Assam - Flood Response and Management (IDEA-FRM)," strives to achieve complete, usable intelligence from the numerous sources of information available in silos despite several initiatives by the state entities.
